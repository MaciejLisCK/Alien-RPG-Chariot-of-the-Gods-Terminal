Some of scripts and content may be missing/different then on the site, since there is no easy way to download all.
Code is extremely difficult to maintain.


# Access shortcuts
Idea is there are access codes that could be found on different places, so players can access terminal with code. Below there are shortcuts to access those codes.

> **Where Are These Access Cards Found?**
> -It's up to the GM but I suggest that all living characters > still possess their cards.
> -Captain Richard Walker's card is found near the Abomination > in the Metapod (this abomination, I decided, is what remains > of the good captain. As you can see from the email exchanges)
> -C. Reynolds is found on the "headless man" reference in GM > material - likely the first dead body the players encounter.
> -Emily Tenwick's card can also be found in a science lab, or > anywhere you feel she met her demise.
